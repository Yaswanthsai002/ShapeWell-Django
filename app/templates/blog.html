            <h1 class="nav-heading"><u>Mindfulness (Sm·πõti</u>)</h1>
            <p>Mindfulness can be formal or informal. Mindfulness as an informal practice is when we choose to pay close attention to what is occurring in the present moment while doing routine activities. It could be something simple like focusing on the feeling of the soles of your feet touching the ground while standing. You can practice it while eating, walking or cleaning your teeth. For example, practising mindfulness when eating means not just knowing that you are eating but being with the whole process ‚Äì feeling the taste, the texture of the food changing, how you chew, what emotions or thoughts arise and how they change.
                On the other hand, formal mindfulness practice is more intensive. Here, we specifically set aside time to explore being mindful of what we are sensing, feeling or thinking. An example of this is mindfulness meditation. It helps us look into our minds at a deeper level and with regular practise can yield deeper insights into our mind.</p>

            <h1 class="nav-heading"><u>Peaceful (SƒÅntih</u>)</h1>
            <p>1. Yoga Can Decrease Stress
                One of the primary reasons many yoga fanatics are initially drawn to the practice is for the stress-relieving benefits of yoga. In fact, most people cite feeling immediate stress relief after even just a few yoga poses or a single session of yoga. Yoga decreases the production of cortisol, a key stress hormone, and increases mindfulness and a sense of inner peace, both of which alleviate stress and help you feel calmer.
                <br> 2. Yoga Can Help Manage Anxiety
                While it‚Äôs not entirely clear exactly how yoga can help people manage anxiety, there‚Äôs quite an extensive body of research demonstrating the ability of a consistent yoga practice to reduce anxiety and even symptoms of PTSD. The emphasis on mindfulness, being present, and honing in on the awareness of your breath may contribute to finding a sense of peace.
                <br>3. Yoga Can Improve Your Mood and Mitigate Depression
                Any form of exercise can produce endorphins and increase mood. Yoga has been studied extensively, and seems particularly effective at alleviating depression, and improving outlook and overall sense of wellbeing. The anti-depressant effect of yoga is due to the fact that yoga decreases the level of cortisol in the body, which is a stress hormone that can inhibit levels of serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that elevates mood and improves your sense of wellbeing, so by lowering cortisol, yoga enables the body to produce more serotonin to feel better.</p>

            <h1 class="nav-heading"><u>Flexibility (Prasrabhi</u>)</h1>
            <p> Yoga Increases Flexibility and Balance of the Body and Mind
                Flexibility and balance in yoga extend beyond the physical poses and positions of your body on the mat. Yoga emphasizes flexibility and balance of the mind as well, teaching you to be more open-minded, adaptable, present, gentle on yourself, and emotionally open and connected. This may sound somewhat airy-fairy, but many people who take up yoga report that while they initially felt somewhat turned off or intimidated by the spiritual/emotional side of yoga, they now appreciate that aspect of the discipline nearly as much (if not more) than the physical work itself.
                <br> Yoga Increases Mobility
                We tend to lose mobility of our joints and muscles as we age. The flexibility work in yoga helps prevent this decline and keeps us feeling more youthful. Yoga poses increase the range of motion of joints, improve spinal mobility and flexibility, and reduce pain associated with stiffness.</p>
